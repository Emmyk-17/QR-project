## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML Tags
- CSS grid


### What I learned

I learnt about the hsl and how to properly align things to the center

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<div>

</div>
```
```css
h1 {
  color: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
div {
  display: flex;
  justify content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```



### Continued development

- Using of div tags
- align all items in the body to the center perfectly


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3school.com) - This helped me for hsl, margin and centerlize the content. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
